## Provider Issues

### "Language model did not provide messages"

**Cause:** Provider quota exhausted.

**Fix:**

1. Check dashboard quota tracker
2. Use a combo with fallback tiers
3. Switch to cheaper/free tier

### Rate Limiting

**Cause:** Subscription quota exhausted.

**Fix:**

- Add fallback: `cc/claude-opus-4-6 → glm/glm-4.7 → if/kimi-k2-thinking`
- Use GLM/MiniMax as cheap backup

### OAuth Token Expired

Routiform auto-refreshes tokens. If issues persist:

1. Dashboard → Provider → Reconnect
2. Delete and re-add the provider connection

---

## Cloud Issues

### Cloud Sync Errors

1. Verify `BASE_URL` points to your running instance (e.g., `http://localhost:20128`)
2. Verify `CLOUD_URL` points to your cloud endpoint (e.g., `https://routiform.dev`)
3. Keep `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values aligned with server-side values

### Cloud `stream=false` Returns 500

**Symptom:** `Unexpected token 'd'...` on cloud endpoint for non-streaming calls.

**Cause:** Upstream returns SSE payload while client expects JSON.

**Workaround:** Use `stream=true` for cloud direct calls. Local runtime includes SSE→JSON fallback.

### Cloud Says Connected but "Invalid API key"

1. Create a fresh key from local dashboard (`/api/keys`)
2. Run cloud sync: Enable Cloud → Sync Now
3. Old/non-synced keys can still return `401` on cloud

---

## Docker Issues

### CLI Tool Shows Not Installed

1. Check runtime fields: `curl http://localhost:20128/api/cli-tools/runtime/codex | jq`
2. For portable mode: use image target `runner-cli` (bundled CLIs)
3. For host mount mode: set `CLI_EXTRA_PATHS` and mount host bin directory as read-only
4. If `installed=true` and `runnable=false`: binary was found but failed healthcheck

### Quick Runtime Validation

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:20128/api/cli-tools/codex-settings | jq '{installed,runnable,commandPath,runtimeMode,reason}'
curl -s http://localhost:20128/api/cli-tools/claude-settings | jq '{installed,runnable,commandPath,runtimeMode,reason}'
curl -s http://localhost:20128/api/cli-tools/openclaw-settings | jq '{installed,runnable,commandPath,runtimeMode,reason}'
```

### Devin In Docker Fails To Start

If Devin is enabled in Docker, use the `routiform:cli` image and mount only the
host credentials file into the container:

```bash
-e DEVIN_BIN=/root/.local/bin/devin \
-v "$HOME/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml:/root/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml:ro"
```

Do not mount `~/.local/bin` or the full `~/.local/share/devin` directory from a
macOS host. That can overwrite the bundled Linux Devin install with macOS symlinks.

Validate the bundled Linux CLI inside the container:

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint /root/.local/bin/devin linhnguyen0944/routiform:cli --version
```

If the binary works but auth still fails, refresh credentials inside a running container:

```bash
docker exec -it routiform /root/.local/bin/devin auth login
```

## Cost Issues

### High Costs

1. Check usage stats in Dashboard → Usage
2. Switch primary model to GLM/MiniMax
3. Use free tier (Gemini CLI, Qoder) for non-critical tasks
4. Set cost budgets per API key: Dashboard → API Keys → Budget

---

## Debugging

### Enable Request Logs

Set `ENABLE_REQUEST_LOGS=true` in your `.env` file. Logs appear under `logs/` directory.

### "Prompt too long" / Context window exceeded

If a request is rejected for context size:

1. Go to **Dashboard → AI → Request context**
2. Enable **auto-compress** if you want the proxy to shrink oversized payloads before forwarding them upstream
3. Retry the request and inspect request logs / dashboard telemetry

Current auto-compress behavior is designed to preserve high-signal context more safely:

- tool output trimming keeps error and warning lines when possible
- recent and important messages are prioritized over low-value history
- dropped history can be replaced with a structured summary of goals, constraints, decisions, prior errors, and open issues
- compression telemetry records dropped messages, truncated tool outputs, compressed thinking blocks, summary insertion, and system truncation

If the request still exceeds the provider limit after compression, reduce very large tool outputs, oversized schemas, or long conversation history before retrying.

### Check Provider Health

```bash
# Health dashboard
http://localhost:20128/dashboard/health

# API health check
curl http://localhost:20128/api/monitoring/health
```

### Runtime Storage

- Main state: `${DATA_DIR}/storage.sqlite` (providers, combos, aliases, keys, settings)
- Usage: SQLite tables in `storage.sqlite` (`usage_history`, `call_logs`, `proxy_logs`) + optional `${DATA_DIR}/log.txt` and `${DATA_DIR}/call_logs/`
- Request logs: `<repo>/logs/...` (when `ENABLE_REQUEST_LOGS=true`)

---

## Circuit Breaker Issues

### Provider stuck in OPEN state

When a provider's circuit breaker is OPEN, requests are blocked until the cooldown expires.

**Fix:**

1. Go to **Dashboard → Settings → Resilience**
2. Check the circuit breaker card for the affected provider
3. Click **Reset All** to clear all breakers, or wait for the cooldown to expire
4. Verify the provider is actually available before resetting

### Provider keeps tripping the circuit breaker

If a provider repeatedly enters OPEN state:

1. Check **Dashboard → Health → Provider Health** for the failure pattern
2. Go to **Settings → Resilience → Provider Profiles** and increase the failure threshold
3. Check if the provider has changed API limits or requires re-authentication
4. Review latency telemetry — high latency may cause timeout-based failures

---

## Audio Transcription Issues

### "Unsupported model" error

- Ensure you're using the correct prefix: `deepgram/nova-3` or `assemblyai/best`
- Verify the provider is connected in **Dashboard → Providers**

### Transcription returns empty or fails

- Check supported audio formats: `mp3`, `wav`, `m4a`, `flac`, `ogg`, `webm`
- Verify file size is within provider limits (typically < 25MB)
- Check provider API key validity in the provider card

---

## Translator Debugging

Use **Dashboard → Translator** to debug format translation issues:

| Mode             | When to Use                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Playground**   | Compare input/output formats side by side — paste a failing request to see how it translates |
| **Chat Tester**  | Send live messages and inspect the full request/response payload including headers           |
| **Test Bench**   | Run batch tests across format combinations to find which translations are broken             |
| **Live Monitor** | Watch real-time request flow to catch intermittent translation issues                        |

### Common format issues

- **Thinking tags not appearing** — Check if the target provider supports thinking and the thinking budget setting
- **Tool calls dropping** — Some format translations may strip unsupported fields; verify in Playground mode
- **System prompt missing** — Claude and Gemini handle system prompts differently; check translation output
- **SDK returns raw string instead of object** — Fixed in v1.1.0: response sanitizer now strips non-standard fields (`x_groq`, `usage_breakdown`, etc.) that cause OpenAI SDK Pydantic validation failures
- **GLM/ERNIE rejects `system` role** — Fixed in v1.1.0: role normalizer automatically merges system messages into user messages for incompatible models
- **`developer` role not recognized** — Fixed in v1.1.0: automatically converted to `system` for non-OpenAI providers
- **`json_schema` not working with Gemini** — Fixed in v1.1.0: `response_format` is now converted to Gemini's `responseMimeType` + `responseSchema`

---

## Resilience Settings

### Auto rate-limit not triggering

- Auto rate-limit only applies to API key providers (not OAuth/subscription)
- Verify **Settings → Resilience → Provider Profiles** has auto-rate-limit enabled
- Check if the provider returns `429` status codes or `Retry-After` headers

### Tuning exponential backoff

Provider profiles support these settings:

- **Base delay** — Initial wait time after first failure (default: 1s)
- **Max delay** — Maximum wait time cap (default: 30s)
- **Multiplier** — How much to increase delay per consecutive failure (default: 2x)

### Anti-thundering herd

When many concurrent requests hit a rate-limited provider, Routiform uses mutex + auto rate-limiting to serialize requests and prevent cascading failures. This is automatic for API key providers.

## Optional RAG / LLM failure taxonomy (16 problems)

Some Routiform users place the gateway in front of RAG or agent stacks. In those setups it is common to see a strange pattern: Routiform looks healthy (providers up, routing profiles ok, no rate limit alerts) but the final answer is still wrong.

In practice these incidents usually come from the downstream RAG pipeline, not from the gateway itself.

If you want a shared vocabulary to describe those failures you can use the WFGY ProblemMap, an external MIT license text resource that defines sixteen recurring RAG / LLM failure patterns. At a high level it covers:

- retrieval drift and broken context boundaries
- empty or stale indexes and vector stores
- embedding versus semantic mismatch
- prompt assembly and context window issues
- logic collapse and overconfident answers
- long chain and agent coordination failures
- multi agent memory and role drift
- deployment and bootstrap ordering problems

The idea is simple:

1. When you investigate a bad response, capture:
   - user task and request
   - route or provider combo in Routiform
   - any RAG context used downstream (retrieved documents, tool calls, etc)
2. Map the incident to one or two WFGY ProblemMap numbers (`No.1` … `No.16`).
3. Store the number in your own dashboard, runbook, or incident tracker next to the Routiform logs.
4. Use the corresponding WFGY page to decide whether you need to change your RAG stack, retriever, or routing strategy.

You can ignore this section if you do not run RAG or agent pipelines behind Routiform.
