# Routiform

One AI endpoint for your apps, tools, and agents.

Routiform is a self-hosted AI gateway and dashboard for teams that want one stable integration point across 60+ providers. You send OpenAI-compatible requests to one `/v1/*` endpoint, and Routiform handles translation, routing, retries, fallback, and operations.

It is built for developers who want to:

- integrate once, then swap providers and models without rewriting client code
- keep Cursor, Devin, Cline, Claude Desktop, Codex, MCP clients, and internal apps on one base URL
- survive provider outages, model deprecations, and quota limits with policy-driven fallback
- reduce cost using combo routing, budget guards, and lower-cost model paths
- run their own gateway with full visibility into keys, logs, quotas, and health

## Why teams choose Routiform

- **One API surface**: OpenAI-compatible routes for chat, embeddings, images, audio, video, rerank, search, and more
- **Resilience by default**: retries, multi-account failover, model-family fallback, and emergency fallback
- **Cost-aware routing**: weighted/priority/P2C strategies, budget controls, and quota-aware decisions
- **Built for agents**: MCP server (25 tools), A2A v0.3 support, memory, and skills
- **Operational control**: dashboard for providers, combos, keys, usage, logs, and endpoint health

- streamable HTTP

See [`docs/MCP-SERVER.md`](docs/MCP-SERVER.md).

## A2A support

Routiform includes an A2A server with:

- JSON-RPC 2.0 task handling
- SSE streaming
- task lifecycle management
- skill exposure for smart routing and quota workflows
- agent discovery via `/.well-known/agent.json`

See [`docs/A2A-SERVER.md`](docs/A2A-SERVER.md).

## Why teams use it instead of wiring providers directly

- one client integration instead of many SDK branches
- self-hosted control over credentials and routing policy
- easier experimentation with new providers and cheaper models
- fewer production incidents from single-provider dependency
- operational visibility without building a custom gateway first
- ready-made agent protocol support instead of stitching MCP/A2A yourself

## Quick start

### Option 1: npm

Requirements:

- Node.js `>=18 <25`

```bash
npm install -g routiform
routiform
```

Open the dashboard:

```text
http://localhost:20128/dashboard
```

Default API base:

```text
http://localhost:20128/v1
```

### Option 2: npx

```bash
npx routiform
```

### Option 3: Docker

```bash
docker pull linhnguyen0944/routiform:cli

docker run -d \
  --name routiform \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 20128:20128 \
  -p 20129:20129 \
  -p 443:443 \
  -e DATA_DIR=/app/data \
  -e INITIAL_PASSWORD="change_your_password" \
  -e DEVIN_BIN=/root/.local/bin/devin \
  -v routiform-data:/app/data \
  -v "$HOME/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml:/root/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml:ro" \
  -v "$HOME/.claude:/root/.claude" \
  -v "$HOME/.openclaw:/root/.openclaw" \
  -v "$HOME/.config/opencode:/root/.config/opencode" \
  -v "$HOME/.continue:/root/.continue" \
  -v "$HOME/.aws:/root/.aws" \
  linhnguyen0944/routiform:cli
```

> **MITM support in Docker:** The MITM proxy (Antigravity, Kiro etc.) can run inside Docker but requires **manual host setup** since the container cannot modify your host's `/etc/hosts` or system keychain. After starting the MITM from the dashboard, run these on your host:

```bash
# 1. Add DNS redirect (run once)
echo '127.0.0.1 daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

# 2. Install MITM cert (copy cert from container to host, then install)
docker cp routiform:/app/data/mitm/server.crt /tmp/routiform-mitm.crt
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /tmp/routiform-mitm.crt
```

If you use `npm install -g routiform` instead, MITM works out of the box — it runs directly on your host with full DNS and keychain access.

If you want to use Devin in Docker, mount only `credentials.toml` from the host so
the Linux CLI inside the container can reuse your existing credentials without
overwriting the bundled Linux install:

```bash
-e DEVIN_BIN=/root/.local/bin/devin \
-v "$HOME/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml:/root/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml:ro"
```

Do not mount `~/.local/bin` or the entire `~/.local/share/devin` directory from
macOS into the container. That can overwrite the Linux Devin binary with macOS
symlinks and cause `spawn devin ENOENT` or binary format errors.

### Option 4: source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/linhnguyen-gt/Routiform.git
cd Routiform
npm install
npm run dev
```

## First-run flow

1. Open `/dashboard`
2. Add one or more provider connections
3. Pick models or sync available models from providers that support live model listing
4. Create a combo if you want fallback or multi-provider routing
5. Point your client to Routiform instead of the upstream provider directly

For Devin connections, authenticate the local CLI first with `devin auth login`, then
import or auto-detect the credentials from the provider setup flow and sync the
available Devin model catalog.

## Example client configuration

### OpenAI SDK compatible clients

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:20128/v1"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-routiform-api-key"
```

### cURL

```bash
curl http://localhost:20128/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-routiform-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello from Routiform"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Provider categories

### Free

Examples include built-in support for free-access workflows such as Qoder AI, Qwen Code, Kiro AI, and similar sources where available.

### OAuth

Examples include Claude Code, Devin, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cline, Kimi Coding, and other account-backed integrations.

### API key

Most commercial providers fit here, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, xAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, Fireworks, Cohere, NVIDIA, and more.

### Custom compatible providers

You can register OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible upstreams using custom base URLs.

## Model routing concepts

### Connections

A connection is one authenticated provider account or endpoint.

### Models

Models can come from:

- built-in provider registries
- synced provider model lists
- custom user-defined model entries

### Combos

A combo is a routing group that tells Routiform which models/providers to try and in what order or policy.

### Policies

Policies influence fallback, degradation, lockout behavior, quota handling, and other runtime decisions.

## Storage and backup

Routiform stores state in SQLite under `DATA_DIR` using `better-sqlite3`.

Default data directory:

```text
~/.routiform/
```

Important backup note:

- back up the entire `DATA_DIR`
- do not copy only `storage.sqlite`
- `server.env` in the same directory contains `STORAGE_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, which is required to restore encrypted provider secrets correctly

See [`docs/BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md`](docs/BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md).

## Important environment variables

Common variables:

| Variable                 | Default                       | Purpose                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                   | `20128`                       | HTTP port                        |
| `HOST`                   | `0.0.0.0`                     | Bind address                     |
| `DATA_DIR`               | `~/.routiform`                | State directory                  |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`     | `600000`                      | Shared upstream timeout baseline |
| `STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | inherits `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | Max gap between SSE chunks       |

Advanced timeout overrides still exist, including:

- `FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `FETCH_HEADERS_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `FETCH_BODY_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `API_BRIDGE_PROXY_TIMEOUT_MS`

## Security notes

- do not commit provider keys or session secrets
- use the dashboard API manager for scoped access where possible
- protect exposed deployments with proper auth and network controls
- never log encryption keys
- validate and sanitize user-facing content when building on top of Routiform
